# example of an empty drive to hold application data

[drives.data]
builder = "empty"
size = "100Mb" # size can be given as string, or as a number in bytes
mount = "/var/lib/app" # default is /mnt/{name}
# format is always ext2, as sqfs is read-only, and a read-only empty drive does not really make sense
